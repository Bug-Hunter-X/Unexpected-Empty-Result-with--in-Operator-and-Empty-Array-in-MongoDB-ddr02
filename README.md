# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior is that a query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` should return all documents, as an empty array should match nothing, thus effectively matching everything.  However, MongoDB interprets this differently, returning an empty result set.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is used to match documents where a field's value is in a specified array. When this array is empty, one might expect to retrieve all documents. The present bug causes the query to return no documents instead.

## Solution
The solution involves using the `$exists` operator or handling the empty array case explicitly in the application logic to achieve the desired all-inclusive behavior.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have MongoDB running and a collection with data.
3. Run `bug.js` to observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct implementation.
